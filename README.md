# checkCPP-Ver


The first useful C++ usage with the fewest lines 

USAGE:

By using __cplusplus macro pre-defined in stdintout header, you can check the C++ standard version which your compiler is running on.
Each std version is dictated with different long value and can be looked up on the Internet

A few common ones:

(202101L - C++23)
(202002L - C++20)
(201703L - C++17)
(201402L - c++14)
(201103L - C++11)
(199711L - C++98)

The older ones can be searched on the Internet so I did not bother putting them here. Search "__cplusplus" macro on Internet for more.
